# NGFX Graphics Abstraction API
NGFX is a low-level graphics abstraction API on top of Vulkan, DirectX12, and Metal.  
It exposes the benefits of next-generation graphics technology via a common
platform abstraction API.  It also supports optional access to the backend data structures,
enabling platform specific optimizations.
